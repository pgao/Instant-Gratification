Instant-Gratification
=====================

Worship the machine, for it is your god.

A collection of things to amuse people quickly, ranging from quotes to music to videos and links.

Evernote has a pretty "interesting" markup system.  You can't get *just* the plaintext, you have to get the ENML formatting that they use, then parse it locally to get the data you want.  There's a few solutions that the Evernote devs have made, but they don't work for what I want to do.  Therefore, parsing is messy.  If you save to Evernote from the Evernote app on Windows, then each line is demarcated with a <br/> tag, but if you save to Evernote from the web-app, each line is demarcated with <br clear="none">.  Very irritating.  Might switch to Dropbox and use plaintext files eventually.
